Supersymmetry has long been understood apart from its role in supergravity.
Schr\"{o}dinger, for example, presented a solution\cite{10.2307/20490744} to the quantum-mechanical Coulomb problem using operator, or supersymmetric, techniques\cite{RevModPhys.23.21}.

In normal quantum mechanics, we know that position states may be expressed as superpositions of momentum states.
In supersymmetric quantum mechanics, superposition states may be expressed as supersuperpositions of supermomentum states, here the supermomentum indicates how quickly a particle moves through superspace.
Supermomentum and superposition are therefore conjugate variables, and the supermomentum operator generates supertranslations.

With experimental control, these systems may prove ripe for superdense coding\cite{PhysRevLett.69.2881} or pave the way towards quantum superemacy\cite{Preskill:2012tg}.
