\section{Introduction}

Supermassive black holes have nonzero supermass, the quantity that couples to $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity, while in theories with more supercharges one may have superdupermassive black holes, and so on.

Supertranslations of superpositions of supersymmetric supermassive black holes in minisuperspace sometimes accrete supernovae at a super-Eddington rate.
They would emite cosmic rays, which could be tested with SuperTIGER.

We need superallowed superselection rules.
