\section{Supersaturation}

First-order phase transitions allow for systems to be diabatically manipulated into metastable states.
One may, for example, supercool a liquid past its freezing point or superheat it past its boiling point.
Once disturbed, such a system may experience a dramatic transition to its ground state.

A chemical solution may similarly become supersaturated.
Once the solution is saturated, additional solute would typically precipitate or fail to desolve.
However, under certain circumstances, one may supersaturate a solution, increasing the solute's concentration past its saturation point.
This can be accomplished by saturating a high-temperature solvent and subsequent cooling, for example.

The human brain may experience saturation directly.
Semantic saturation, or semantic satiation, is when a word is repeated so often that it starts to sound peculiar or lose its semantic meaning.
We speculate that there may be words or phrases that allow \emph{semantic supersaturation}, where, despite being repeated so often, past the bounds of typical semantic saturation or good taste, meaning is retained.
We know no example and a recent experiment by the authors failed with a promising candidate, documented in Reference~\cite{self}.
Nevertheless, we believe there is no fundamental obstacle to semantic supersaturation and any difficulties are ultimately superable.
It may be beyond the ability of most people, requiring a superman or, indeed, Superman\footnote{We do note, however, that Superman, being from the planet Krypton, is not human in the biological sense of the word.}\cite{tippett:2009}
