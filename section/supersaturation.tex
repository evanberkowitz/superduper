\section{Supersaturation}

First-order phase transitions allow for systems to be diabatically manipulated into metastable states.
One may, for example, supercool a liquid past its freezing point or superheat it past its boiling point.
Once disturbed, such a system may experience a dramatic transition to its ground state.

A chemical solution may similarly become supersaturated.
Once the solution is saturated, additional solute would typically precipitate or fail to desolve.
However, under certain circumstances, one may supersaturate a solution, increasing the solute's concentration past its saturation point.
This can be accomplished by saturating a high-temperature solvent and subsequent cooling, for example.

The human brain may experience saturation directly.
Semantic saturation, or semantic satiation, is when a word is repeated so often that it starts to sound peculiar or lose its semantic meaning.
Here we define \emph{semantic supersaturation}, where a word can be repeated often, past the bounds of typical semantic saturation or good taste, and yet retain its meaning.
